    # #NEWFRAME One sunny day, Jackie's father took him to a very special place called a bank. Jackie was excited to learn about this new place. His father told him, "Banks are where we keep our money safe, Jackie."

    # #NEWFRAME Inside the bank, Jackie saw people lined up at counters, talking to bank employees. His father explained, "This is called a teller window, Jackie. We can deposit or withdraw money here."

    # #NEWFRAME Jackie's father then showed him a small, plastic card. He explained, "This is called a debit card, we can use it to buy things without carrying cash around. The money comes directly from our bank account."

    # #NEWFRAME Next, they walked over to a machine in the corner of the bank. His father said, "This is an ATM machine, Jackie. It's like a mini bank where we can deposit and withdraw money, even when the bank is closed."

    # #NEWFRAME Jackie then noticed a woman receiving a stack of cash from a bank employee. "That's a loan, Jackie," his father said. "Banks lend money to people for big things like a house or a car. But, we have to pay it back with a little extra, that extra is called interest."

    # #NEWFRAME They then passed by a section where people were happily chatting with bank employees. "These are financial advisors, Jackie. They help people plan how to save and spend their money wisely."

    # #NEWFRAME Jackie's father then showed him a big, metal door. "Behind this door is the bank's safe. It's where the bank keeps everyone's money secure."

    # #NEWFRAME On their way home, Jackie's father opened a small account for Jackie. He explained, "This is your savings account, Jackie. Every time you save money from your pocket change, we can put it here. The bank will even give you a little extra money over time, that's called interest."

    # #NEWFRAME Jackie smiled, feeling very grown-up. He had learned a lot about banks and their services. He couldn't wait to start saving his money in his very own bank account. And that's how our little friend Jackie learned about the world of banking, in a simple, fun and engaging way."""
